# JCEInfo README
JCEInfo is a lab/test util for experimenting with JCE/JCA providers.
it is not at all complete or finished but provides some tools that might prove useful.

## Tab JCE Providers
Lists the installed providers and the services they provide

## Tab Add JCE Provider
Allows addition of providers at runtime

### Examples of providers that may be added at runtime

	org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider 
	iaik.security.provider.IAIK

## Tab Test JCE Provider performance
Work in progress. The idea is to provide funtionality for benchmarking various services and algorithmns of installed providers
